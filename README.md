# UWA-Data-Homework-Leaflet-Challenge

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

Added layer controls to viualise 2 other map styles.

Created a legend that will provide context for map data.
